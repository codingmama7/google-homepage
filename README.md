My first HTML/CSS project from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
<br>
I learned that creating a stylesheet will help make the html page a lot easier to look at. Though a simple project, it was definitely very new and challenging to me. As of 06-Jan-2020, it's not quite what I would like it to be, however, I am going to continue with the curriculum and keep learning. I hope to see my skill and ability improve over the course of the curriculum.
